# Daily-minimum-temperature-predictions-using-RNN
- Using Daily Minimum Temperatures in Melbourne dataset which contains data of the daily minimum temperatures recorded in Melbourne from 1981 to 1990. 
- In addition to be using Tensorflow's layers for processing sequence data such as Recurrent layers or LSTMs you will also use Convolutional layers to improve the
  model's performance.
